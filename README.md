# Role playing tilesets for Tiled

These Wang tilesets use:
 - ProBono's 6x6 Mega Tile Pack V2 - Grid50, as included in rptools'
   MapTool. Please make sure that the tiles are reachable in directory
   ".maptool-rptools/resource/ProBono's 6x6 Mega Tile Pack V2 - Grid50/6x6 Open Areas/Dungeon Tile217.jpg"

 - Any set of blob tiles from http://cr31.co.uk/stagecast/wang/intro.html,
   save as 0.gif, 1.gif and so on

And unfortunately these tile sets require the Wang Tile rotation feature of
